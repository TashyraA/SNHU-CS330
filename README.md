# 3D Fruit Bowl Scene — Portfolio Reflection

This project was a chance to bring together everything I’ve learned about computational graphics and visualization. I created a 3D fruit bowl scene with a stylized mug, countertop, flower vase, cutting board, and layered lighting. Every object was intentional — from the alternating background to the soft palette choices — designed to make the scene feel calm, organized, and joyful.

## How do I approach designing software?
I start by thinking about how the user or viewer will experience the scene. I visualized the layout, choose a palette that feels emotionally resonant, and break the design into modular components. This helps me stay organized and iterate quickly.

## What new design skills has my work helped me craft?
This project helped me refine my use of lighting, texture mapping, and object placement. I learned how to harmonize technical structure with visual clarity — like adjusting the mug’s handle using torus geometry or layering fruit with subtle shadows to create depth.

## What design process did I follow?
I built the scene piece by piece, testing each object’s placement and behavior. I used OpenGL primitives and transformations, then added textures and lighting to bring it to life. I kept everything modular so I could tweak details without breaking the whole layout.

## How could tactics from my design approach be applied in future work?
Modular design and palette consistency are tactics I’ll keep using in future projects — whether it’s UI, animation, or interactive dashboards. These strategies help me stay focused and make my work feel intentional and uplifting.

## How do I approach developing programs?
I develop in layers: first the geometry, then the behavior, then the polish. I comment my code clearly and test each feature as I go. I also use iteration heavily — I refined the fruit placement, lighting angles, and mug proportions multiple times.

## What new development strategies did I use?
I used mesh transformations, texture mapping, and lighting effects to create realism. I also structured my code into reusable functions so I could experiment without losing control. This helped me stay flexible while keeping the scene stable.

## How did iteration factor into my development?
Iteration was everything. I adjusted the fruit bowl’s layout, tweaked the lighting to reduce glare, and refined the mug’s handle until it felt right. Each pass made the scene more balanced and expressive.

## How has my approach to developing code evolved?
Throughout the milestones, I became more methodical and intentional. I started with basic shapes and gradually layered in complexity. By the end, I was thinking about emotional tone, visual harmony, and maintainability all at once.

## How can computer science help me reach my goals?
Computer science gives me the tools to build interactive, visually uplifting experiences. Whether I’m designing planners, dashboards, or animations, I want my work to feel both technically solid and emotionally encouraging.

## How do computational graphics help in my educational pathway?
This project deepened my understanding of OpenGL, scene composition, and visual storytelling. It helped me connect design principles with code structure in a way that feels intuitive and scalable — skills I’ll carry into future courses.

## How do computational graphics help in my professional pathway?
These skills are directly transferable to UI/UX design, game development, and interactive media. I now feel more confident building scenes that are not just functional, but also visually engaging and emotionally resonant.
